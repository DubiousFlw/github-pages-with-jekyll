# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for GitHub Pages

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. 

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I have a bunch of things that i coud tell you about myself but I will keep it short. 
    I wish I could have programming skills to make money, I know the fundamentals of Java and Pyton but that is it. I have a B.S. in information technology and a host of ceritifications that I wont even go into listing right now.
